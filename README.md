# Juniper-Mist-Automation
This is a growing collection of scripts used to manage our Mist infrastructure. These scripts currently block/unblock mac addresses.

For this script to work you must do the following:

  1.Store these files in the same directory. mist.py pulls functions from mistfunctions.py
  
  2.Store your API key as an environmental variable
  
  3.Update the org ID
