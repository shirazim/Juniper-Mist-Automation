# Juniper-Mist-Automation
This is a growing collection of scripts used to manage our Mist infrastructure

For this script to work you must do the following:
  *Store these files in the same directory. mist.py pulls functions from mistfunctions.py
  *Store your API key as an environmental variable
  *Update the org ID
